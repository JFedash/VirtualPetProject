## What does our software do?
Our team has created a fun and interactive game that teaches responsibility and other important life skills to players of all ages. You can choose from multiple characters, each with unique stats and abilities. Weâ€™ve included save game functionality, engaging music, and parental controls to make sure kids can enjoy the game responsibly.
